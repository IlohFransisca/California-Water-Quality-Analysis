# Water Quality Analysis Project

This project aims to assess the safety of drinking water using a real-world environmental dataset from the California Department of Water Resources. This project analyzes surface and ground water to evaluate 16 parameters (e.g., pH, lead, arsenic, nitrate) against EPA and WHO thresholds. It applies data science techniques and machine learning to classify water samples as safe or unsafe based on environmental safety standards.

## Objective

- Analyze water sample data for contamination.
- Label samples as Safe or Unsafe using EPA and WHO thresholds.
- Predict unsafe sources using machine learning.
- 99% accuracy using Random Forest to classify unsafe water samples.
- Identify feature importance.
- Visualize geographic patterns of contamination.

## 🧪 Dataset

- **Source:** California Department of Water Resources
- **Size:** 4.6 million+ rows, 18 columns
- **Parameters include:** pH, Lead, Arsenic, Fluoride, Cadmium, Chromium, and more.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, folium)
- Streamlit (planned)
- Google colab

## 📊 Features
