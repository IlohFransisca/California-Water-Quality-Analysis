# Water Quality Analysis Project

This project aims to assess the safety of drinking water using a real-world environmental dataset from the California Department of Water Resources. It applies data science techniques and machine learning to classify water samples as safe or unsafe based on environmental safety standards.

## 🔍 Objective

- Analyze water sample data for contamination.
- Label samples as Safe or Unsafe using EPA and WHO thresholds.
- Predict unsafe sources using machine learning.
- Identify feature importance.
- Visualize geographic patterns of contamination.

## 🧪 Dataset

- **Source:** California Department of Water Resources
- **Size:** 4.6 million+ rows, 18 columns
- **Parameters include:** pH, Lead, Arsenic, Fluoride, Cadmium, Chromium, and more.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, folium)
- SQL
- Streamlit (planned)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Features

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Safe/Unsafe Labeling
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Machine Learning Classification
- Feature Importance Evaluation
- Geospatial Visualization (Folium)
- Charts of safety counts by year and parameter

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Deploy an interactive Streamlit web app
- Integrate water quality APIs
- Perform time-series trend analysis
